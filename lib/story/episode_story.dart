    textEpisode: "In Episode 1, Uranohoshi Girls' High School student Chika-chan "
        "discovered the school idol group Î¼'s while trying to catch a runaway flyer. "
        "Having had looked for something to devote her all to for a long time, she "
        "was inspired and decided to form her own school idol group.\n\n"

        "With help from her friend You-chan, Chika-chan tried to gather members "
        "at the school entrance ceremony, without any response from the student "
        "body. You-chan and Chika-chan then encountered first year students Ruby-chan "
        "and Hanamaru-chan, and Chika-chan tried to interest them in joining the "
        "school idol club. Yoshiko-chan suddenly interrupted the conversation and "
        "Hanamaru-chan recognized her from kindergarten. Yoshiko-chan ran off with "
        "the other two first years chasing her, and Chika-chan proclaimed she would "
        "recruit them later.\n\n"

        "After third year student and student council president Dia-san denied "
        "Chika-chan permission to form a school idol club, Chika-chan and You-chan "
        "took the ferry to meet up with Kanan-chan, who told them she would not "
        "be re-entering school for a while longer. The three of them saw a helicopter "
        "flying past, in which Mari-chan was sitting in.\n\n"

        "You-chan told Chika-chan she would join the school idol club, saying she "
        "had always wanted to be passionate about something together with Chika-chan. "
        "Together they confronted Dia-san once again, who rejected them once more, "
        "questioning how they were planning to compose songs.\n\n"

        "When Riko-chan unexpectedly showed up as a transfer student in Chika-chan "
        "and You-chan's class, Chika-chan recognized her and asked if she would "
        "join the school idol club. \"Kimeta yo Hand in Hand\" was performed by "
        "Chika-chan, You-chan and Riko-chan as an insert song, and the episode "
        "ended with Riko-chan declining Chika-chan's request."
