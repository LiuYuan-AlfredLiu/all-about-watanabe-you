    episodeTitle: "I Want to Shine!!",
    episodeDescription: "In Episode 1, Uranohoshi Girls' High School student Chika-chan "
        "discovered the school idol group μ's while trying to catch a runaway flyer. "
        "Having had looked for something to devote her all to for a long time, she "
        "was inspired and decided to form her own school idol group.\n\n"

        "With help from her friend You-chan, Chika-chan tried to gather members "
        "at the school entrance ceremony, without any response from the student "
        "body. You-chan and Chika-chan then encountered first year students Ruby-chan "
        "and Hanamaru-chan, and Chika-chan tried to interest them in joining the "
        "school idol club. Yoshiko-chan suddenly interrupted the conversation and "
        "Hanamaru-chan recognized her from kindergarten. Yoshiko-chan ran off with "
        "the other two first years chasing her, and Chika-chan proclaimed she would "
        "recruit them later.\n\n"

        "After third year student and student council president Dia-san denied "
        "Chika-chan permission to form a school idol club, Chika-chan and You-chan "
        "took the ferry to meet up with Kanan-chan, who told them she would not "
        "be re-entering school for a while longer. The three of them saw a helicopter "
        "flying past, in which Mari-chan was sitting in.\n\n"

        "You-chan told Chika-chan she would join the school idol club, saying she "
        "had always wanted to be passionate about something together with Chika-chan. "
        "Together they confronted Dia-san once again, who rejected them once more, "
        "questioning how they were planning to compose songs.\n\n"

        "When Riko-chan unexpectedly showed up as a transfer student in Chika-chan "
        "and You-chan's class, Chika-chan recognized her and asked if she would "
        "join the school idol club. \"Kimeta yo Hand in Hand\" was performed by "
        "Chika-chan, You-chan and Riko-chan as an insert song, and the episode ended "
        "with Riko-chan declining Chika-chan's request."

    episodeTitle: "Catch the Transfer Student!",
    episodeDescription: "In Episode 2, Chika-chan persisted in trying to persuade "
        "Riko-chan into becoming a school idol and composing songs for their group. "
        "However, Riko continued to politely decline the proposal.\n\n"

        "Meanwhile, You-chan had been working on costume ideas for the school idol "
        "group. Chika-chan initially was not impressed, saying they did not look "
        "like something a school idol would wear, until You showed her one drawing "
        "she fell for.\n\n"

        "Still only having two members and no one to compose their songs, Chika-chan "
        "and You-chan yet again faced Dia-san with their club application. Chika-chan’s "
        "mention of μ's and how they must have struggled only having three members "
        "initially upset Dia-san, who corrected Chika-chan on her pronunciation "
        "of the group name and started quizzing her on μ's trivia. The conversation "
        "was unknowingly broadcasted to the entire school.\n\n"

        "Chika-chan and You-chan met Hanamaru-chan and Ruby-chan again, luring the "
        "shy Ruby-chan out of hiding using a lollipop. Chika-chan learned that Yoshiko-chan "
        "had not been at school after running out of class on the first day, and "
        "that Dia-san is Ruby-chan’s older sister.\n\n"

        "As Kanan-chan, You-chan, Chika-chan and Riko-chan were out diving, Riko-chan "
        "at first had troubles using her imagination to hear the sound of the ocean "
        "as per Kanan-chan’s advice. Diving down again, Chika-chan and You-chan "
        "pointed to a spot where the sunlight hit the water, and the three of them "
        "managed to experience the sound of the ocean.\n\n"

        "At school Riko-chan told Chika-chan and You-chan she would compose for "
        "the school idol group, but not become a school idol herself. They realized "
        "they did not have any lyrics written, and together the three of them tried "
        "writing lyrics at the Takami family’s ryokan."
