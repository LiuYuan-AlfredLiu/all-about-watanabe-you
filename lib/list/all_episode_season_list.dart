    episodeDescription: "In Episode 1, Uranohoshi Girls' High School student Chika-chan "
        "discovered the school idol group μ's while trying to catch a runaway flyer. "
        "Having had looked for something to devote her all to for a long time, she "
        "was inspired and decided to form her own school idol group.\n\n"

        "With help from her friend You-chan, Chika-chan tried to gather members "
        "at the school entrance ceremony, without any response from the student "
        "body. You-chan and Chika-chan then encountered first year students Ruby-chan "
        "and Hanamaru-chan, and Chika-chan tried to interest them in joining the "
        "school idol club. Yoshiko-chan suddenly interrupted the conversation and "
        "Hanamaru-chan recognized her from kindergarten. Yoshiko-chan ran off with "
        "the other two first years chasing her, and Chika-chan proclaimed she would "
        "recruit them later.\n\n"

        "After third year student and student council president Dia-san denied "
        "Chika-chan permission to form a school idol club, Chika-chan and You-chan "
        "took the ferry to meet up with Kanan-chan, who told them she would not "
        "be re-entering school for a while longer. The three of them saw a helicopter "
        "flying past, in which Mari-chan was sitting in.\n\n"

        "You-chan told Chika-chan she would join the school idol club, saying she "
        "had always wanted to be passionate about something together with Chika-chan. "
        "Together they confronted Dia-san once again, who rejected them once more, "
        "questioning how they were planning to compose songs.\n\n"

        "When Riko-chan unexpectedly showed up as a transfer student in Chika-chan "
        "and You-chan's class, Chika-chan recognized her and asked if she would "
        "join the school idol club. \"Kimeta yo Hand in Hand\" was performed by "
        "Chika-chan, You-chan and Riko-chan as an insert song, and the episode ended "
        "with Riko-chan declining Chika-chan's request."

    episodeDescription: "In Episode 2, Chika-chan persisted in trying to persuade "
        "Riko-chan into becoming a school idol and composing songs for their group. "
        "However, Riko continued to politely decline the proposal.\n\n"

        "Meanwhile, You-chan had been working on costume ideas for the school idol "
        "group. Chika-chan initially was not impressed, saying they did not look "
        "like something a school idol would wear, until You showed her one drawing "
        "she fell for.\n\n"

        "Still only having two members and no one to compose their songs, Chika-chan "
        "and You-chan yet again faced Dia-san with their club application. Chika-chan’s "
        "mention of μ's and how they must have struggled only having three members "
        "initially upset Dia-san, who corrected Chika-chan on her pronunciation "
        "of the group name and started quizzing her on μ's trivia. The conversation "
        "was unknowingly broadcasted to the entire school.\n\n"

        "Chika-chan and You-chan met Hanamaru-chan and Ruby-chan again, luring the "
        "shy Ruby-chan out of hiding using a lollipop. Chika-chan learned that Yoshiko-chan "
        "had not been at school after running out of class on the first day, and "
        "that Dia-san is Ruby-chan’s older sister.\n\n"

        "As Kanan-chan, You-chan, Chika-chan and Riko-chan were out diving, Riko-chan "
        "at first had troubles using her imagination to hear the sound of the ocean "
        "as per Kanan-chan’s advice. Diving down again, Chika-chan and You-chan "
        "pointed to a spot where the sunlight hit the water, and the three of them "
        "managed to experience the sound of the ocean.\n\n"

        "At school Riko-chan told Chika-chan and You-chan she would compose for "
        "the school idol group, but not become a school idol herself. They realized "
        "they did not have any lyrics written, and together the three of them tried "
        "writing lyrics at the Takami family’s ryokan."

          "With Mari-chan's arrival to the school, she introduced herself as the new "
          "chairwoman of Uranohoshi Girls' High School. Dia-san, who knew Mari-chan "
          "back from their first year in Uranohoshi, pointed out how unbelievable "
          "it was for a third year to be the new chairwoman. Mari-san showed her "
          "proof and stated that she came to support Chika-chan, You-chan, and Riko-chan. "
          "She then challenged them to fill the gym with audience in order to get "
          "her approval for their School Idol Club. The three second year students "
          "realized that there weren't enough students in their school to fill the "
          "gym, which caused them to advertise their concert in other places as well.\n\n"

          "They started handing out flyers in front of Numazu Station, where Riko-chan "

          "While training, Chika-chan, You-chan, and Riko-chan thought up of possible "
          "names for their currently nameless school idol group. They soon stumbled "
          "upon the name \"Aqours\", which was written on the beach, and decided to "
          "use it as their school idol group's name.\n\n"

          "The newly-named school idol group Aqours continued to advertise their upcoming "
          "concert. In Chika-chan's house, Aqours continued to work on their dance "
          "steps until Riko-chan and You-chan noticed that Chika-chan fell asleep, "
          "and decided to call it a day. Shima, Chika-chan's elder sister, drove You-chan "
          "home as no buses ran when it is late at night.\n\n"

          "Before their concert, Aqours worried about people not attending due to "
          "the rain. They laughed it off and stood behind the stage's curtain, hand "
          "in hand. However, when the curtains raised, they only had a small group "
          "of audience. Included in the audience were Mari-san, Ruby-chan, Hanamaru-chan, "
          "and a disguised Yoshiko-chan. Despite this, they continued their concert "
          "and performed \"Daisuki dattara Daijoubu!\" while Kanan-chan and Dia-san "
          "listened from outside the gym.\n\n"

          "A power outage occurred halfway through the song, halting their performance. "
          "Chika-chan continued to sing, followed by You-chan and Riko-chan, until "
          "she started to cry. Right before they lost hope, Chika-chan's sister Mito-san "
          "arrived and said that Chika-chan told her the wrong start time. Meanwhile, "
          "Dia-san secretly hooked up a backup generator and the power returned, which "
          "illuminated the gym that was filled with audience. Aqours then resumed "
          "their performance.\n\n"

          "After Aqours's concert, Dia-san went in front of them then said that their "
          "success was only due to the efforts of previous school idols and the town's "
          "good will. Chika-chan answered she knew it but that it was their only chance "

          "Met by a very excited Chika-chan, Ruby-chan and Hanamaru-chan started "

          "After Ruby-chan officially joined the school idol club, she confronted "
          "Hanamaru-chan at the library. Ruby-chan explained how she suspected that "

          "was something Ruby-chan wanted to do, but that she also thought maybe "
          "Hanamaru-chan was interested herself. Ruby-chan drew a parallell to Hoshizora"
          "Rin also thinking she was not fit to be a school idol, and admitted she "
          "had always wanted to become a school idol with Hanamaru-chan. Hanamaru-chan "

        "Whimpering in the school idol clubroom, Yoshiko-chan explained she knew "
        "she was not a fallen angel and wanted to be a normal high school student. "
        "Chika-chan, on the other hand, got the idea of fallen angel idols as a "
        "way to make them stand out more. Therefore, she asked Yoshiko-chan if she "

        "Much to Dia-san’s dismay, the school idol club uploaded a fallen angel "
